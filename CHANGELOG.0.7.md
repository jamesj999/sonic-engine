# OpenGGF 0.7 — Development changelog

Unreleased. This line carries the work promoted from `next` after 0.6.20260911.
The [0.7 roadmap](docs/project/v0.7-roadmap.md) prioritizes complete stock-game
campaigns; feature/API publication remains subject to the 0.8 roadmap.

## Gameplay and presentation

- **Widescreen presentation:** ordinary UI/HUD surfaces, titles, results, endings,
  diagnostics, all three special stages, scene effects, and trace-video capture.
  Native 320x224 remains the gameplay/trace authority. 352x224 and 400x224 are
  supported presentation targets, 528x224 is a best-effort smoke tier, and
  800x224 remains exploratory.
- **S3K campaign work:** the promoted development baseline includes further MHZ
  and FBZ work, LBZ Big Arm, Super Emerald sanctuary/progression, and powered
  effects. Complete routes, finales, and continuous replay chains remain gates.

## Development features carried forward

- **Unpublished Mod API candidate:** mod loading, creator tooling, characters,
  standalone games, and custom-zone work are now available on the development
  line. The API descriptor remains the version/publication authority; this
  branch rollover does not publish or freeze it.
- **Existing feature foundations:** retain editor, racing, prepared-loading,
  audio-core, and mod regression coverage while stock campaigns mature.

## Build and release

- **Release-line integration:** preserve hosted release builds, snapshot policy
  checks, current launcher artifact selection, Linux packaging, and automatic
  publication on master pushes from the 0.6 release branch.
- **Rollover-safe tooling:** SDK scaffold dependencies and the complete-audio
  launcher derive artifact versions from build metadata. Keep the unpublished
  API candidate independent from the engine branch version.

See the [development ledger](docs/changelog/v0.7-prerelease-detailed.md) for
integration evidence and the [release summary](docs/changelog/v0.7-release-summary.md)
for scope and limitations. No new feature is certified by this rollover alone.
