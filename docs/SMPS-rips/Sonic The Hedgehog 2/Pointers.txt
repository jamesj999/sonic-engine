Notes:
- The Bank List uses the following format:
	Bits 0-4 (1F): Song Pointer ID in the respective bank
	Bits  5  (20): Compression (00 - Saxman compressed, 20 - uncompressed)
	Bits  6  (40): disable PAL music speedup (for Drowning jingle)
	Bits  7  (80): ROM Bank (00 - 0F0000, 80 - 0F8000)
- All builds from proto 08-21 until the final Sonic 2 build use a different Tempo algorithm than the Simon Wai prototype.
  Sonic 2 final: Tempo Counter += Tempo Increment, delay unless the addition overflows
- The GoodGen (W) version of Sonic 2 is Rev 01.
- sound driver versions:
			size	size
	ROM Date	compr	uncompr	notes
	1992-09-25	0F64	1308	final build

- The Nick Arcade prototype uses an unmodified Sonic 1 sound driver.
- PSG Envelope 0D differs between Simon Wai and prototype 08-21/.../final.
- All DAC sounds but 81, 82 and 85 were changed between Simon Wai and prototype 08-21/.../final.
- DAC sound 86 was shortened by 100h bytes between prototype 09-14 and CENSOR.
- The Speed Shoe tempo values differ between prototype 08-21/09-14/CENSOR/Beta 4/5 and Beta 6-8/final.
  The values in the Simon Wai proto are the same ones as used in Sonic 1.
- Most work on the sound driver was done between the Simon Wai proto and proto 08-21, including the Spindash SFX code and misc fixes/improvements.
- between proto 08-21 and 09-14, special handling for the "Gloop" sound effect (sound ID DA) was added
- between proto 09-14 and CENSOR/Beta 4, the following features were added:
  - the PAL speed fix for music (including the option to disable it per-song)
  - support for Saxman compressed music
- The code for handling the Push SFX from S1 was removed between Beta 4 and 5.
- The way of handling Game Pause was modified between Beta 7 and 8. All other modifications between Beta 5 and the final build were minor.
