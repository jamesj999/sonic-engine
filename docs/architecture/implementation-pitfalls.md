# Shared implementation pitfalls

Read the relevant section when working on coordinates, objects, rendering, rewind,
headless tests, or audio. S3K-specific routing is in [AGENTS_S3K.md](../../AGENTS_S3K.md).

The things that cost the most time when missed.

**Coordinates.** ROM `x_pos` / `y_pos` map to `getCentreX()` / `getCentreY()`. `getX()` /
`getY()` are top-left render bounds — mixing them produces a ~19px vertical offset and
wrong collision. When porting disassembly that touches `x_pos` / `y_pos`, default to the
centre APIs unless the code is explicitly about sprite bounds, render extents, or collision
box edges; route playable-sprite native writes through `NativePositionOps`. If camera,
collision, object anchoring, or scripted movement drifts relative to the player, suspect
this first. The debug HUD `Pos:` line prints top-left, **not** ROM centre — don't quote it
against a disassembly trace without converting. Y increases downward (Mega Drive
convention). VDP coordinates in the disassembly are offset by +128; the engine uses direct
screen coordinates.

**Object clocks.** `ObjectInstance.update(int vIntRunCount, ...)` receives the
object-visible ROM `V_int_run_count`, stored by `ObjectManager` as `vblaCounter`. It is not
the manager's executed-frame counter or the ROM `Level_frame_counter`; lag frames can
de-phase those clocks. When porting a frame gate, name and read the clock the disassembly
actually uses instead of treating the update parameter as a generic frame number.

**Terminology** differs from standard Sonic 2 naming: **Pattern** = 8x8 tile, **Chunk** =
16x16 (composed of Patterns), **Block** = 128x128 (composed of Chunks).

**Sprite tiles are column-major:** `tileIndex = column * heightTiles + row`. H-flip draws
from the last column first, V-flip from the bottom row first.

**Pattern IDs exceed the VDP's 11 bits.** The engine adds a virtual pattern ID space above
`0x7FF` with a non-overlapping base per category; use
`GraphicsManager.renderPatternWithId()` when IDs exceed the VDP range, and pick a fresh
base for a new category. Range table in
[docs/status/known-discrepancies.md](../status/known-discrepancies.md).

**ENEMY touch responses poll every frame** while the overlap persists (matching the ROM
`Touch_Loop`) — SPECIAL/monitor contacts stay edge-triggered. Don't add consumed-once
"already hit" latches to the enemy touch path.

**S1 silently ignores solid-bit setters.** `setTopSolidBit()` / `setLrbSolidBit()` no-op
under `CollisionModel.UNIFIED`, so springs and plane switchers are automatic no-ops for S1.

**Rewind coverage is guarded.** A new spawnable object without a recreate path, an
uncaptured `final` scalar, or an object reference not captured as a rewind id fails
`TestRewindCoverageGuard`. A global static manager consumed across frames but unregistered
fails `TestStaticStateRewindCoverageGuard` — fix it with a `RewindSnapshottable` adapter,
not a baseline entry, unless the gap is genuinely intentional.

**Claimed hardware work is memoized.** `HardwareTimingJob` shares one immutable rewind
snapshot per claimed job across checkpoints and drops it in every mutator. Unclaimed jobs
are re-snapshotted each capture because `coordinatorPreparation` still hands out their live
preparation, which a caller may step or restore. Do not widen the memo to unclaimed jobs
without first removing that alias.

**Headless tests:** call `GroundSensor.setLevelManager(...)` and
`Camera.updatePosition(true)` *after* the level load, and prefer
`@ExtendWith(SingletonResetExtension.class)` over manual teardown. Set
`startup.legalDisclaimer=false` in tests that boot the full `Engine`.

**`FixBugs` / `fixBugs` assembly paths.** All three disassemblies are built with the
bug-fix conditional OFF — `FixBugs = 0` (`s1disasm/sonic.asm:20`,
`skdisasm/sonic3k.asm:38`, `skdisasm/s3.asm:25`) and `fixBugs = 0`
(`s2disasm/s2.asm:27`) — because that is what the shipped ROMs do, and the traces
record shipped-ROM behaviour. **Always model the `FixBugs = 0` path**, including
when it is plainly a bug: the un-fixed path is the accurate one, and taking the
fixed branch will desync a trace that compares the affected field. There are ~327
such blocks in s1disasm, ~262 in s2disasm and ~111 in skdisasm, so you will meet
them often.

When you port code near one of these conditionals, **say so in a comment** — name
the flag, state which branch the engine takes and why, and describe what the fixed
branch would do. That costs a line now and is the only thing that will make a
future "support the bug-fixed revisions" effort tractable, since the sites are
otherwise invisible once ported. `Camera.java:122-124` and
`Sonic1BatbrainBadnikInstance.java:394` are existing examples of the shape.

**Audio accuracy:** the FM core is the Nuked-OPN2 port (`audio.synth.nuked`); its only
reference is the pinned `ym3438.c`, and `Ym2612Chip` is engine glue over it. For the PSG
reference the libvgm cores, for the sequencer the SMPSPlay source, rather than simplified
versions. Diagnose against a source of truth instead of twiddling knobs.
