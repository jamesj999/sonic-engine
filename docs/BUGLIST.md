# Bug List

Last updated: 2026-01-15

- [ ] If a sound is playing when the level is switched, it gets stuck looping that part of the sound.
- [ ] If you're standing to the left of a monitor and the ground is tilted slightly towards it, Sonic fails to jump.
- [ ] Some spikes kill you from the side when you jump next to them while holding direction into them.
- [ ] There's a small collision hole on the left side of the EHZ bridges.
- [ ] EHZ bridges cause you to move from rolling to running when you move over them.
- [ ] Some sound engine discrepancies (some instruments have volume issues, springs don't sound correct).
- [ ] Double-length spirals in EHZ don't work (Sonic only completes the first half then falls out).
- [ ] Objects still have collision in debug movement mode.
- [ ] Camera maximum height is not yet implemented.
- [ ] Some situations (ring loss on spikes in MCZ) result in rings being instantly recollected.
- [ ] Finishing a special stage puts you at your last coordinates, instead of the coordinates of the last signpost (or, if none, fall back to act start position).
- [ ] Both special stage and end of act cards shouldn't start counting the score until a set delay.
